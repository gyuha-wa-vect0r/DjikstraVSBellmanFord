## üõ†Ô∏è Future Improvements

**Enhancing Realism with Real-Time Data Integration**
- Currently, the algorithms rely on static road data and do not incorporate dynamic information such as real-time traffic or road closures.
- Improvement directions:  
  - Utilize KakaoMap and Naver Map APIs to collect real-time data and integrate it into the graph‚Äôs weights.  
  - Example: Dynamically increase weights of heavily congested roads to reroute towards more optimal paths.
- Expected Benefits:  
  - Evolve into a more practical route-finding algorithm.  
  - Improve user experience and distinguish from commercial services.

**Introducing Advanced Algorithms**
- To overcome the limitations of traditional algorithms (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford), explore **Graph Neural Networks (GNN)** or reinforcement learning-based pathfinding.  
- Graph Neural Networks (GNN):  
  - Represent road networks as graphs and learn relationships between nodes to predict the optimal path.  
  - Reflect real-time data during the learning process for dynamic path updates.
- Reinforcement Learning:  
  - Learn from user-chosen routes to provide personalized path recommendations.  
  - Continuously improves by rewarding user-satisfying routes.
- Expected Benefits:  
  - Significantly enhance accuracy and efficiency of AI-based route finding.  
  - Offer personalized features.

**Personalized Route Recommendations**
- Current algorithms only consider the road structure, without factoring in user driving habits, preferences, or destination characteristics.
- Improvement directions:  
  - Incorporate user-preferred road types (highways, quiet roads, etc.) or prioritize certain regions.  
  - Analyze past route choices to deliver personalized recommendations.
- Expected Benefits:  
  - Provide user-optimized routes.  
  - Increase user satisfaction and practicality.

**Integrated Comparative Study with Commercial Map Services**
- Conduct in-depth analysis of route optimization standards employed by commercial map services such as KakaoMap and Naver Map.  
- Understand how they incorporate traffic, road closures, and restricted areas.  
- Evaluate the algorithm‚Äôs practical performance through comparative experiments using commercial service APIs.
